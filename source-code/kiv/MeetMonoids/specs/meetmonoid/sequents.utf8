;;; This file is used to add additional theorems.
;;; 1. Two semicolons start a line comment
;;; 2. (: ... :) delimit a comment. They can be nested!
;;; 3. Reading stops after ;;; END
;;; 4. Theorems have the form

<name> : <sequent> ; used for : <some_flags> ; comment : <some_comment> ;

     'used for' and 'comment' are optional.
     <some_comment> may be any text not containing a ;
     <some_flags> is a comma separated list with information that the lemma should
     be used as a simplifier rule or something like that. Since you can add or delete
     simplifier rules etc. by menu commands, you can always omit 'used for' if you want.
     Note: changing the flags or the comment only works if the sequent is also changed!!!
     possible flags are:

     s (simplifier rule), ls (local simplifier rule), f (forward), lf (local forward),
     e (elimination), c (cut), lc (local cut)
